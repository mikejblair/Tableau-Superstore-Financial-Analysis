# Financial Analysis of Superstore Sales Data (2017)

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive financial analysis of sales and revenue data from an anonymous superstore for the year 2017. The primary objective was to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) to identify potential areas for divestment and resource investment to boost profits in 2018.

## Tools & Techniques

- **Data Wrangling & Analysis**: Python (Pandas, Numpy)
- **Statistical Analysis**: Profit margin calculations, discount impact assessment
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn for creating insightful charts and graphs
- **Reporting**: Developed recommendations based on data-driven insights to guide strategic decision-making

## Key Findings

1. **Sales and Profit Trends**: 
   - Overall, the superstore demonstrated positive trends in sales (+20.36%) and profits (+14.24%) for 2017. 
   - However, the profit margin showed a concerning decline due to certain subcategories with negative profit margins.

2. **Subcategory Performance**:
   - Significant subcategories with negative profit margins included Binders (-21.57%), Appliances (-21.90%), Bookcases (-14.78%), and Tables (-15.84%).
   - These losses were primarily driven by high discount rates, particularly in Binders (37.23%), Machines (30.61%), and Tables (26.13%).

3. **Impact of Discounts**:
   - High discount rates in specific subcategories led to substantial lost profits, with Binders alone contributing to a loss of $128K.
   - A histogram analysis revealed that 86.1% of discounts over 60% were concentrated in just three subcategories: Binders, Tables, and Machines.

## Recommendations

1. **Discount Strategy**: 
   - Implement a cap on discounts at 50% across all products to mitigate profit losses.
   - Focus on reducing discount rates specifically for Binders, Tables, and Machines.

2. **Marketing Strategy**:
   - Increase targeted marketing efforts for high-earning subcategories like Copiers, Phones, and Accessories.
   - Concentrate digital advertising during the highest and lowest sales periods (November-March).

3. **Future Analysis**:
   - Continuously monitor the impact of adjusted discount rates on sales volume and profit margins.
   - Adjust marketing and pricing strategies based on the performance of targeted subcategories.
